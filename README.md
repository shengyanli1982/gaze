# GAZE: A Lightweight Go Package for Triggering Callbacks on Variable Changes

When developing applications, it's common to need code that triggers when a variable's value changes. Typically, this requires writing a significant amount of boilerplate code to monitor these changes, which can be tedious and time-consuming. `GAZE` is here to help!

### Why Create `GAZE`?

Writing repetitive and complex code not only wastes time but also drains the joy out of programming. I wanted to save my time and help others do the same, which is why I created `GAZE`. This package simplifies the process of monitoring variable changes, allowing you to focus on what truly matters in your code.

### Why Use `GAZE`?

Do you want to streamline your coding process and reduce unnecessary complexity? `GAZE` offers a straightforward solution that allows you to:

-   **Focus on Your Code**: Spend more time on core functionalities and less on repetitive tasks.
-   **Enhance Productivity**: Complete your work faster and with fewer errors.
-   **Enjoy More Free Time**: Finish your tasks early so you can enjoy your personal time.

Hereâ€™s why `GAZE` stands out:

-   **Simple**: `GAZE` is easy to use and understand.
-   **Lightweight**: It has no dependencies, keeping your project lightweight.
-   **Reliable**: Thoroughly tested for dependability.
-   **Callback Support**: Seamlessly integrates callback functions when variable values change.

### Practical Use Cases

`GAZE` can be particularly useful in the following scenarios:

-   **Configuration Management**: Automatically reload configurations when changes are detected.
-   **Logging**: Log changes to critical variables for auditing or debugging purposes.
-   **Automation**: Execute specific tasks in real-time when certain conditions are met.
-   **Monitoring**: Monitor the values of important variables and take action when changes occur.
-   **Notification Systems**: Trigger notifications or alert systems when a variable changes.

# Installation

To install `GAZE`, simply run:

```bash
go get github.com/shengyanli1982/gaze
```

# Quick Start

`GAZE` uses generics to define variable types, making it compatible with most types of variables.

### Methods

`GAZE` provides two primary methods: `Set` and `Get` to set and get the value of the variable. If the value of the variable changes, the callback function will be triggered.

-   **Set**: Set the value of the variable.
-   **Get**: Get the value of the variable.

### Callbacks

-   **OnSet**: The callback function is triggered when the variable's value is set and remains unchanged.
-   **OnGet**: The callback function is triggered when the variable's value is accessed.
-   **OnChange**: The callback function is triggered when the variable's value changes upon being set.

### Example

Using `GAZE` is very simple. Here is an example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/shengyanli1982/gaze"
)

type demoCallback[T any] struct{}

func (cb *demoCallback[T]) OnSet(value T) {
    fmt.Printf(">> OnSet: %v\n", value)
}

func (cb *demoCallback[T]) OnGet(value T) {
    fmt.Printf(">> OnGet: %v\n", value)
}

func (cb *demoCallback[T]) OnChange(oldValue T, newValue T) {
    fmt.Printf(">> OnChange: %v -> %v\n", oldValue, newValue)
}

func newTestCallback[T any]() gaze.CallbackFuncs[T] {
    return &demoCallback[T]{}
}

func main() {
    // Create a new ReactiveValue with an int value
    ov := gaze.NewReactiveValue(11, newTestCallback[int]())

    // Get the value from the ReactiveValue
    got := ov.Get()
    fmt.Printf("got: %v\n", got)

    // Set a new value to the ReactiveValue and get it
    ov.Set(3)
    got = ov.Get()
    fmt.Printf("got: %v\n", got)
}
```

**Result**

```bash
$ go run demo.go
>> OnGet: 11
got: 11
>> OnChange: 11 -> 3
>> OnGet: 3
got: 3
```
